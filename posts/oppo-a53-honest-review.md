Oppo A53 was recently released in August 25, 2020 and as being a budget phone, Oppo A53 by default become one of the competitors for Xiaomi, the best in the business for this range. The main specifications of this phone are given below rather than its packing cover which only give information regarding three specs -

1. 13MP, f/2.2, AI Rear Camera, 1080p 30fps
2. 2 MP, f/2.4, (macro) (rear)
3. 2 MP, f/2.4, (depth) (rear)
4. 16MP Front Camera, 1080p 30fps
5. Display 90 Hz 6.5 inches, 720 x 1600 pixels
6. Battery 5000 mAh with 18w Fast Charging
7. Bluetooth 5.0
8. Back-Centred fingerprint sensor
9. A really loud front speakers as well as Bottom speakers
10. Snapdragon 460, 1.8Ghz (An extremely old processor)
11. Memory available in different sizes 64/4, 128/6

As being a serious user here I provide breakdown of each specs provide my user experience and at the end I’ll suggest U a very good phone at the same price tag. You’ll definitely not going to regret that and comment if U like to have another honest review for the suggested phone. Here’s my opinion -

### Battery

This phone has a massive battery of 5000mAh with fast charger of 18w. It can charge my phone in 1.5 hrs and last for a day without even having to thought of charging it again. To be exact it takes 7 min to reduce the battery by a single unit. Giving it an avg time of 700mins of 12 hrs+ run time as well as a great standby time which is quite great in my opinion.

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth used on this phone is 5.0. But regarding 5.0, I felt it more like below average. It took 3-4 sec for connecting to my Bluetooth earphones (Sony WI XB400).

### Camera

It has a 13MP AI Rear camera while some other company providing 48MP at the same range. Even for 13MP, I felt the camera is not as good as it should be. Images are little blurry and not clear and if you are going for night mode or low light photography, then definitely **DO NOT BUY IT**.

### Display

It has a massive 6.5-inch IPS LCD 90Hz display with Gorilla Glass 3. 6.5 inch for a display is quite decent unless it is affecting the quality. 1080p resolution is not as good as it should be and this display is damaging one to eyes. Provided display is of 90Hz which is more of a Show piece and do not fall for that. Generally videos are not going to be in 90fps anytime soon and if they were then its processor is not going to support them. Eyes are going to pain a lot if U are going to watch a movie that makes the display unbearable for long session of time.

### Fingerprint Sensor

Fingerprint sensor is quite terrible at its work and since the day I bought it, It never worked properly not even a single time. My rating would be simply 2/10.

### OS

It uses Android 10 based Color OS 7.2 as its stock OS which contains a lots of blot wares by default or as system apps making them unable to uninstall from the software. Also, by default OS occupies 2.8/4 GB of RAM and some 10/64 GB of Rom. As compared to the best android operating system (Android One or Default google rom) and One Plus’s Oxygen OS, it doesn’t even have a chance to stand.

### Processor

Despite its opponents using gaming processors or decent ones at this range, this phone is running at an old snapdragon 460 processor which is literally extremely slow. It can’t even run its own operating system (Android Color OS 7.2) properly. Even your homesceen is gonna lag with this phone. For gamers - As being an Ace-tier player in PUBG, I know the value of fps counts and a good processor and with this phone I’ve not been able to complete a single match with decent performance.PS: Gyroscope has a lot of delay.

### Speakers

Speakers are quite descent. Both call and general speaker have more than decent sound. Its loudness is quite high and sound quality is normal. I remember in a Baarat I made a call and beside all the factors (DJ and Dance), By only using the front speaker, I was able to hear the call audio properly.

This is the breakdown of my user experience for Oppo A53. The suggested phone is Redmi Note 9 Pro at the same price and better specs. Thank You for reading this post and Hope You’d like my review.
